\section{Epidemic modeling} \label{sec:models}


History, place our models in the world of epidemic models

putting the modeling into a regression-oriented framework

stochastic models: stochastic SIR, branching process, TSIR (Finkenst√§dt, Grenfell)

model selection, residuals, ...




\subsection{On the reproduction number} \label{R0}


The point process model \eqref{eqn:twinstim} features a
reproduction number derived from its branching process interpretation.
New infections may either originate from the endemic component representing
immigration independent of the history of the epidemic, or they are triggered by
some previously infected individual via the epidemic component. As soon as an
individual becomes infected, it spreads the disease
according to an inhomogeneous Poisson process with rate 
$\eta_j \cdot g(t-t_j)\cdot f(\norm{\bm{s}-\bm{s_j}})$ around its origin.
Since this process is independent of the individuals parentage and of other
infections, 
\begin{equation*}
  \mu_j = \eta_j \cdot
  \left[ \int_0^{T-t_j} g(t) \,dt \right] \cdot
  \left[ \int_{\bm{W}-\bm{s_j}} f(\bm{s}) \,d\bm{s} \right]
\end{equation*}
is the expected number of secondary infections triggered by an infective $j$
during the remaining observation period $[t_j,T]$ in the observation region
$\bm{W}$. 
Thus, infectives with $\mu_j < 1$ are expected to cause less than one secondary
infection.

An interesting insight provides a comparison with the basic reproduction number
obtained from the simple SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) compartmental model
for a closed population without demographics \citep{kermack.mckendrick1927}
represented by a system of ordinary differential equations:
\begin{align*}
  \frac{dS}{dt} &= -\beta S I 
  & \frac{dI}{dt} &= \beta S I - \gamma I 
  & \frac{dR}{dt} &= \gamma I
\end{align*}
Here, $N=S(t) + I(t) + R(t)$ is the (constant) population size, $\beta$ is the
transmission rate given contact between a susceptible and an infectious
individual, 
and $\gamma$ is the recovery rate ($1/\gamma$ is the average infectious period).
For this model, the basic reproduction number, i.e.\ the average number of
secondary cases arising from a single infective put into an entirely susceptible
population, is $R_0 = N \beta / \gamma$
\citep[see, e.g.,][Section 2.1]{Keeling.Rohani2008}.
A similar, but spatio-temporal epidemic model can be established from the point
process model \eqref{eqn:twinstim} with the following settings:
no endemic component,
homogeneous individuals ($\eta_j \equiv \beta$),
homogeneous mixing in space ($f(\bm{s}) \equiv 1$),
and exponential decay of infectivity ($g(t) = e^{-\alpha t}$).
Then, for $T \rightarrow \infty$,
\begin{equation*}
  \mu = \beta \cdot
  \left[ \int_0^\infty e^{-\alpha t} \,dt \right] \cdot
  \left[ \int_{\bm{W}-\bm{s_j}} 1 \,d\bm{s} \right] =
  \beta \cdot \abs{\bm{W}} / \alpha \:,
\end{equation*}
which corresponds to the above basic reproduction number interpreting
$\abs{\bm{W}}$ as the population size, $\beta$ as the transmission rate and
$\alpha$ as the removal rate.
Like in classic epidemic models, the process is sub-critical if $\mu < 1$ holds,
which means that its eventual extinction is almost sure. However, in the full
point process model \eqref{eqn:twinstim} with an endemic component, new
infections may always occur via ``immigration''. Hence, the reproduction number
as estimated from this model is adjusted for such new infections occurring
independently of previous infections. It therefore tends to be lower than the
one estimated from a classical non-spatial SIR model without immigration of
infectives.
