	Frequently cited examples include the cell, a network of chemicals

	systems have been modeled as random graphs, it is increasingly recognized
	that the topology and evolution of real networks are governed by
	robust organizing principles. This article reviews the recent advances
	in the field of complex networks, focusing on the statistical mechanics
	of network topology and dynamics. After reviewing the empirical data
	that motivated the recent interest in networks, the authors discuss
	the main models and analytical tools, covering random graphs, small-world
	and scale-free networks, the emerging theory of evolving networks,
	and the interplay between topology and the network’s robustness against

	Methods: Index cases were recruited after reporting to a primary healthcare
	center with symptoms. Members of their households were followed-up
	with repeated home visits.
	
	Results: Assuming a Weibull model and accounting for selection bias
	inherent in our field study design, we used symptom-onset times from
	14 pairs of infector/infectee to estimate a mean serial interval
	of 3.6 days (95% confidence interval = 2.9 – 4.3 days), with standard
	deviation 1.6 days.
	
	Conclusion: The household serial interval of influenza may be longer
	than previously estimated. Studies of the complete serial interval,
	based on transmission in all community contexts, are a priority.},

	disease.RESULTS:First, we re-analyse data from a classic epidemiological
	study, the 1854 London cholera outbreak. Using 321 disease sites
	as input, we evaluate the locations of 13 neighbourhood water pumps.
	The Broad Street pump - the outbreak's source- ranks first, situated
	in the top 0.2% of the geoprofile. We extend our study with an analysis
	of reported malaria cases in Cairo, Egypt, using 139 disease case
	locations to rank 59 mosquitogenic local water sources, seven of
	which tested positive for the vector Anopheles sergentii. Geographic
	profiling ranks six of these seven sites in positions 1-6, all in
	the top 2% of the geoprofile. In both analyses the method outperformed
	other measures of spatial central tendency.CONCLUSIONS:We suggest
	that geographic profiling could form a useful component of integrated

	Modelling is driven by the conditional intensity function, which

	additive-multiplicative conditional intensity model proposed by Höhle
	(2009), and also borrows from earthquake research, especially from
	the formulation of the space-time ETAS model in Ogata (2003). Estimation
	is performed by means of full maximum likelihood, which for general
	point processes in space requires the evaluation of two-dimensional
	integrals. Therefore, various methods of numerical integration are
	investigated as a prerequisite for maximum likelihood inference.
	
	The particular application of interest is the stochastic modelling
	of the transmission dynamics of the two most common meningococcal
	strains observed in Germany in 2002--2008. The application showed
	that the proposed model and its estimation by the provided thoroughly

  abstract = {In England and Wales, a large-scale multiple statistical surveillance
	system for infectious disease outbreaks has been in operation for
	nearly two decades. This system uses a robust quasi-Poisson regression
	algorithm to identify aberrances in weekly counts of isolates reported
	to the Health Protection Agency. In this paper, we review the performance
	of the system with a view to reducing the number of false reports,
	while retaining good power to detect genuine outbreaks. We undertook
	extensive simulations to evaluate the existing system in a range
	of contrasting scenarios. We suggest several improvements relating
	to the treatment of trends, seasonality, re-weighting of baselines
	and error structure. We validate these results by running the existing
	and proposed new systems in parallel on real data. We find that the
	new system greatly reduces the number of alarms while maintaining
	good overall performance and in some instances increasing the sensitivity.},

  abstract = {Infectious disease counts from surveillance systems are typically
	observed in several administrative geographical areas. In this paper,
	a non-linear model for the analysis of such multiple time series
	of counts is discussed. To account for heterogeneous incidence levels
	or varying transmission of a pathogen across regions, region-specific
	and possibly spatially correlated random effects are introduced.
	Inference is based on penalized likelihood methodology for mixed
	models. Since the use of classical model choice criteria such as
	AIC or BIC can be problematic in the presence of random effects,
	models are compared by means of one-step-ahead predictions and proper
	scoring rules. In a case study, the model is applied to monthly counts
	of meningococcal disease cases in 94 departments of France (excluding
	Corsica) and weekly counts of influenza cases in 140 administrative
	districts of Southern Germany. The predictive performance improves
	if existing heterogeneity is accounted for by random effects.},

	to create animations, and give an overview to the R package animation,

	With the animation package, we can export the animations produced
	by R into a variety of formats, such as a web page, a GIF animation,
	a Flash movie, a PDF document, or an MP4/AVI video, so that users
	can publish the animations fairly easily. The design of this package
	is flexible enough to be readily incorporated into web applications,
	e.g., we can generate animations online with Rweb, which means we
	do not even need R to be installed locally to create animations.
	We will show examples of the use of animations in teaching statistics
	and in the presentation of statistical reports using Sweave or knitr.
	In fact, this paper itself was written with the knitr and animation
	package, and the animations are embedded in the PDF document, so
