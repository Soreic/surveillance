	Uncertainty regarding the underlying disease parameters is propagated
	through to the decision process via Bayesian posterior inference.
	The strategies produced through this framework are adaptive: vaccination
	schedules are iteratively adjusted to reflect the anticipated trajectory
	of the epidemic given the current population state and updated parameter
	estimates. This document briefly covers the background and methodology
	underpinning the implementation provided by the package and contains
	extensive examples showing the functions and methods in action.},

  abstract = {In this Master's Thesis, a novel combination of point process models
	continuous in space-time is proposed for infectious disease data.
	Modelling is driven by the conditional intensity function, which
	enables a step towards a regression framework for self-exciting spatio-temporal
	point processes. The model is an extension of the discrete space
	additive-multiplicative conditional intensity model proposed by Höhle
	(2009), and also borrows from earthquake research, especially from
	the formulation of the space-time ETAS model in Ogata (2003). Estimation
	is performed by means of full maximum likelihood, which for general
	point processes in space requires the evaluation of two-dimensional
	integrals. Therefore, various methods of numerical integration are
	investigated as a prerequisite for maximum likelihood inference.
	
	The particular application of interest is the stochastic modelling
	of the transmission dynamics of the two most common meningococcal
	strains observed in Germany in 2002--2008. The application showed
	that the proposed model and its estimation by the provided thoroughly
	\texttt{R} implementation are applicable and valuable for the analysis
	of spatio-temporal infectious disease data.},
