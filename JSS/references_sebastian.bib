  abstract = {In this Master's Thesis, a novel combination of point process models
	continuous in space-time is proposed for infectious disease data.
	Modelling is driven by the conditional intensity function, which
	enables a step towards a regression framework for self-exciting spatio-temporal
	point processes. The model is an extension of the discrete space
	additive-multiplicative conditional intensity model proposed by Höhle
	(2009), and also borrows from earthquake research, especially from
	the formulation of the space-time ETAS model in Ogata (2003). Estimation
	is performed by means of full maximum likelihood, which for general
	point processes in space requires the evaluation of two-dimensional
	integrals. Therefore, various methods of numerical integration are
	investigated as a prerequisite for maximum likelihood inference.
	
	The particular application of interest is the stochastic modelling
	of the transmission dynamics of the two most common meningococcal
	strains observed in Germany in 2002--2008. The application showed
	that the proposed model and its estimation by the provided thoroughly
	\texttt{R} implementation are applicable and valuable for the analysis
	of spatio-temporal infectious disease data.},
