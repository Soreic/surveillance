  number = {1},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND:In computer supported outbreak detection, a statistical
	method is applied to a collection of cases to detect any excess cases
	for a particular disease. Whether a detected aberration is a true
	outbreak is decided by a human expert. We present a technical framework
	designed and implemented at the Swedish Institute for Infectious
	Disease Control for computer supported outbreak detection, where
	a database of case reports for a large number of infectious diseases
	can be processed using one or more statistical methods selected by
	the user.RESULTS:Based on case information, such as diagnosis and
	date, different statistical algorithms for detecting outbreaks can
	be applied, both on the disease level and the subtype level. The
	parameter settings for the algorithms can be configured independently
	for different diagnoses using the provided graphical interface. Input
	generators and output parsers are also provided for all supported
	algorithms. If an outbreak signal is detected, an email notification
	is sent to the persons listed as receivers for that particular disease.CONCLUSIONS:The
	framework is available as open source software, licensed under GNU
	General Public License Version 3. By making the code open source,
	we wish to encourage others to contribute to the future development
	of computer supported outbreak detection systems, and in particular
	to the development of the CASE framework.},

  abstract = {In this Master's Thesis, a novel combination of point process models
	continuous in space-time is proposed for infectious disease data.
	Modelling is driven by the conditional intensity function, which
	enables a step towards a regression framework for self-exciting spatio-temporal
	point processes. The model is an extension of the discrete space
	additive-multiplicative conditional intensity model proposed by Höhle
	(2009), and also borrows from earthquake research, especially from
	the formulation of the space-time ETAS model in Ogata (2003). Estimation
	is performed by means of full maximum likelihood, which for general
	point processes in space requires the evaluation of two-dimensional
	integrals. Therefore, various methods of numerical integration are
	investigated as a prerequisite for maximum likelihood inference.
	
	The particular application of interest is the stochastic modelling
	of the transmission dynamics of the two most common meningococcal
	strains observed in Germany in 2002--2008. The application showed
	that the proposed model and its estimation by the provided thoroughly
	\texttt{R} implementation are applicable and valuable for the analysis
	of spatio-temporal infectious disease data.},

	of human resources and increased communication between local stakeholders
	(groups and persons whose actions are affected by emerging infectious
	diseases and animal health) were instrumental for successful implementation.
	The primary lesson learned was that mobile phone–based surveillance
	of animal populations is acceptable and feasible in lower-resource
	settings. However, any system implementation plan must consider the
	time needed to garner support for novel surveillance methods among
