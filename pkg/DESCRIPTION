Description: Statistical methods for the modeling and
        monitoring of time series of counts, proportions and
        categorical data, as well as for the modeling of 
        continuous-time point processes of epidemic phenomena.
        The monitoring methods focus on aberration detection in
        count data time series originating from public health surveillance
        of communicable diseases, but applications could just as well
        originate from environmetrics, reliability engineering, econometrics,
        or social sciences. The package implements many typical
        outbreak detection procedures such as Farrington et al (1996),
        Noufaily et al (2012), or the negative binomial LR-CUSUM method
        described in Höhle and Paul (2008). A novel CUSUM approach combining
        logistic and multinomial logistic modeling is also included.
        The package contains several real-world data sets, the ability
        to simulate outbreak data, and to visualize the results of the
        monitoring in temporal, spatial or spatio-temporal fashion.
        A recent overview of the available monitoring procedures is
        given by Salmon et al (2016).
        For the retrospective analysis of epidemic spread, the package
        provides three endemic-epidemic modeling frameworks with
        tools for visualization, likelihood inference, and simulation.
        'hhh4' estimates models for (multivariate) count time series
        following Held et al (2005), Paul et al (2008), Paul and Held (2011),
        Held and Paul (2012), and Meyer and Held (2014).
        'twinSIR' models the susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) event
        history of a fixed population, e.g, epidemics across farms or
        networks, as a multivariate point process as proposed by Höhle (2009).
        'twinstim' estimates self-exciting point process models for a
        spatio-temporal point pattern of infective events, e.g.,
        time-stamped geo-referenced surveillance data, as proposed by
        Meyer et al (2012).
        A recent overview of the implemented space-time modeling frameworks
        for epidemic phenomena is given by Meyer et al (2016).
