All code of the surveillance package is available under GPL-3
(http://www.r-project.org/Licenses/GPL-3).

However, the functionality of the 'twinstim' function depends
on the R package 'gpclib', which has a license restriction. 
Quoting from the 'gpclib' R package license file:

  Free for non-commercial use; commercial use prohibited (see the files
   `gpc.c' and `gpc.h' for details)

As a consequence the fitting of 'twinstim' models is restricted by the same
license, i.e.

	 Free for non-commercial use; commercial use prohibited.

Should you intend to use twinstim for commercial purposes the details
in the 'gpclib' mention the following:

  You may not use this software, in whole or in part, in support of any
  commercial product without the express consent of the author.

According to the text in 'gpc.c' the author is: Alan Murta (email:
gpc@cs.man.ac.uk). On his webpage the following additional details are
given (copied from http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~toby/alan/software/#Licensing):

 If you wish to use GPC in support of a commercial product, you must
 obtain an official GPC Commercial Use Licence from The University of
 Manchester. Please email for details.

The developers of 'surveillance' hope to be able to use the 'rgeos'
library at some point to lift the above license restriction, but
currently the above restriction to 'twinstim' model fitting applies.
