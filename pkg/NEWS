=====

* The algo_glrpois function now has an additional "ret" arguments,
  where one specifies the return type. The arguments of the underlying
  c functions have been changed to include an additional direction and
  return type value arguments.

* added restart argument to the algo.glrpois control object, which
allows the user to control what happens after the first alarm has been
generated

* experimental algo.glrnb function is added to the package. All calls to
algo.glrpois are now just alpha=0 calls to this function. However, 
the underlying C functions differentiate between poisson and negative case
