\title{Simulates data based on the model proposed by Paul and Held (2011)
}

\description{
   Simulates a multivariate time series of counts based on the
   Poisson/Negative Binomial model as described in Paul and Held (2011).
}

\usage{
\method{simulate}{hhh4}(object, nsim = 1, seed = NULL, y.start = NULL,
         subset = 1:nrow(object$stsObj), coefs = coef(object),
         components=c("ar","ne","end"), simplify=nsim>1, ...)
}

\arguments{
  \item{object}{
    an object of class \code{"hhh4"}.
  }
  \item{nsim}{
    number of time series to simulate. Defaults to \code{1}.
  }
  \item{seed}{
    an object specifying how the random number generator should be
    initialized for simulation (via \code{\link{set.seed}}). The
    initial state will also be stored as an attribute \code{"seed"} of
    the result. The original state of the \code{\link{.Random.seed}}
    will be restored at the end of the simulation.
    By default (\code{NULL}), neither initialization nor recovery will
    be done.
    This behaviour is copied from the \code{\link{simulate}.lm} method.
  }
  \item{y.start}{
    vector or matrix (with \code{ncol(object$stsObj)} columns) with
    starting counts for the epidemic components. 
    If \code{NULL}, the observed means in the respective units of the
    data in \code{object} during \code{subset} are used.
  }
  \item{subset}{
    time period in which to simulate data. Defaults to the whole period.
  }
  \item{coefs}{
    coefficients used for simulation from the model in \code{object}.
    Default is to use the fitted parameters.
    Note that the \code{coefs}-vector must be in the same order and
    scaling as \code{coef(object)}.
  }
  \item{components}{
    character vector indicating which components of the fitted model
    \code{object} should be active during simulation. For instance,
    a simulation with \code{components="end"} is solely based on the
    fitted endemic mean.
  }
  \item{simplify}{
    logical indicating if only the simulated counts (\code{TRUE}) or the
    full sts object (\code{FALSE}) should be returned for every
    replicate. Defaults to counts only if \code{nsim>1}, such that the
    result will be an array of dimension \code{c(nTime, nUnits, nsim)}.
  }
  \item{\dots}{unused (argument of the generic).}
}

\details{
  Simulates data from a Poisson or a Negative Binomial model
  with mean
  \deqn{\mu_{it} = \lambda_{it} y_{i,t-1} + 
                   \phi_{it} \sum_{j \neq i} w_{ji} y_{j,t-1} + 
                   \nu_{it}}{%
        \mu_it = \lambda_it y_i,t-1 + 
                  \phi_it \sum_j w_ji y_j,t-1 + 
                  \nu_it}
  where
  \eqn{\lambda_{it}>0}, \eqn{\phi_{it}>0}, and \eqn{\nu_{it}>0} are 
  parameters which are modelled parametrically.
  The function uses the model and parameter estimates of the fitted
  \code{object} to simulate the time series.

  With the argument \code{coefs} it is possible to simulate from  
  the model as specified in \code{object}, but with different 
  parameter values.
}

\value{
An object of class \code{"sts"} in case \code{nsim = 1}, and
a list of such objects otherwise.
