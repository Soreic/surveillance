\title{Aggregate the the series of an sts object}
\description{
  Method to aggregate the matrix slots of an sts object.
  Either the time series is aggregated so a new sampling frequency of
  \code{nfreq} units per time slot is obtained -- i.e as in
  \code{\link{aggregate.ts}}. The other option is to aggregate over all
  \code{ncol} units.

  Note: The function is not 100\% consistent with what the generic
  function \code{\link{aggregate}} does.

  \describe{
    \item{x = "sts", by="time", nfreq="all",...}{
      \describe{
	\item{x}{an object of class \code{sts}}
	\item{by}{a string being either "time" or "unit"}
	\item{nfreq}{new sampling frequency if \code{by=="time"}. If
	  \code{nfreq=="all"} then all time instances are summed.}
	\item{...}{not used}
      }
      returns an object of class \code{sts}
    }
  }
}

\details{
    Warning: In case the aggregation is by unit the upperbound slot is set
    to NA. Furthermore the MAP object is left as  is, but the object
    cannot be plotted anymore.
