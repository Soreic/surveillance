\title{
  Power-Law and Nonparametric Neighbourhood Weights for \code{hhh4}-Models
}

\description{
  Set up power-law or nonparametric weights for the neighbourhood
  component of \code{\link{hhh4}}-models as proposed by Meyer and Held (2014).
  Without normalization, power-law weights are
  \eqn{w_{ji} = o_{ji}^{-d}}{w_ji = o_ji^-d}, where \eqn{o_{ji}}{o_ji}
  is the order of neighbourhood between regions \eqn{i} and \eqn{j},
  see \code{\link{nbOrder}}.
}

\usage{
W_powerlaw(maxlag, normalize = TRUE,
           log = FALSE, initial = if (log) 0 else 1)

W_np(maxlag, to0 = FALSE, normalize = TRUE,
     initial = log(zetaweights(2:maxlag)))
}

\arguments{
  \item{maxlag,to0}{a single integer specifying a limiting order of
    neighbourhood.\cr
    For \code{W_powerlaw}, weights are positive
    up to \code{maxlag} and set to 0 for higher orders. If spatial
    dependence is not to be truncated at some high order, \code{maxlag}
    should be set to the maximum neighbourhood order in the network of
    regions.\cr
    For \code{W_np}, individual weights are estimated up to order
    \code{maxlag}. Higher orders are either assumed to have 0 weight
    (\code{to0=TRUE}), or the weight at \code{maxlag} is carried forward
    (\code{to0=FALSE}, default).
    Since the first-order weight is fixed to 1 for identifiability,
    \code{maxlag-1} parameters are to be estimated in this nonparametric
    specification.
  }
  \item{normalize}{logical indicating if the weights should be normalized
    such that the rows of the weight matrix sum to 1 (default).}
  \item{log}{logical indicating if the decay parameter \eqn{d} should be
    estimated on the log-scale to ensure positivity.}
  \item{initial}{initial value of the parameter vector.}
}

\value{
  a list which can be passed as a specification of parametric
  neighbourhood weights in the \code{control$ne$weights} argument of
  \code{\link{hhh4}}.

\examples{
data("measlesWeserEms")

## data contains neighbourhood orders as required for parametric weights
neighbourhood(measlesWeserEms)[1:6,1:6]
max(neighbourhood(measlesWeserEms))  # max order is 5

## fit a power-law decay of spatial interaction
## in a hhh4 model with seasonality and random intercepts in the endemic part
measlesModel <- list(
    ar = list(f = ~ 1),
    ne = list(f = ~ 1, weights = W_powerlaw(maxlag=5, log=FALSE)),
    end = list(f = addSeason2formula(~-1 + ri(), S=1, period=52),
               offset = population(measlesWeserEms)),
    family = "NegBin1")

## fit the model
set.seed(1)  # random intercepts are initialized randomly
measlesFit <- hhh4(measlesWeserEms, measlesModel)
summary(measlesFit)  # "neweights.d" is the decay parameter

## plot the spatio-temporal weight o^-d as a function of neighbourhood order
plot(1:5, (1:5)^-coef(measlesFit)["neweights.d"],
     xlab="Neighbourhood order", ylab="Weight", type="b")
## also with regard to the SE, there is no evidence for a power law of
## spatial interaction in this small observation region with only 17 districts;
## a possible simpler model is first-order dependence, i.e., using
## 'weights = neighbourhood(measlesWeserEms)==1' in the 'ne' component
