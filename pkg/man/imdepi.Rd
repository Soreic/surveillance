\title{
  Occurrence of Invasive Meningococcal Disease in Germany
}

\description{
  Data on the spatio-temporal location of 636 cases of invasive
  meningococcal disease caused by two specific meningococcal finetypes
  in Germany. 
}
\usage{
data(imdepi)
}
\format{
  Loading the data in \code{imdepi} gives an object of type
  \code{"\link{epidataCS}"} (a list with components \code{events},
  \code{stgrid}, \code{W} and \code{qmatrix}).
}
\details{
  The dataset contains a slightly modified version of the data analyzed in
  Meyer et al. (2012) represented as an \code{"epidataCS"} object, which
  is a list with components \code{events}, \code{stgrid}, \code{W}, and
  \code{qmatrix}.

  The \code{events} entry is a \code{"\linkS4class{SpatialPointsDataFrame}"}
  object (ETSR89 projection, i.e. EPSG code 3035, with unit \sQuote{km})
  containing 636 events, each with the following entries:
  \describe{
    \item{ID:}{Unique identifier of the case.}
    \item{time:}{Time of the case occurrence measured in number of days since origin.}
    \item{tile:}{Tile ID in the spatio-temporal grid (\code{stgrid}) of
      endemic covariates, where the event is contained in.
      This corresponds to one of the 413 districts of Germany.
    }
    \item{type:}{Event type, a factor with levels \code{"B"} and \code{"C"}.}
    \item{eps.t:}{Maximum temporal interaction range for the event.
      Here set to 30 days.}
    \item{eps.s:}{Maximum spatial interaction range for the event.
      Here set to 200 km.}
    \item{sex:}{Sex of the case, i.e. a factor with levels \code{"male"}
      and \code{"female"}.} 
    \item{agegrp:}{Factor giving the age group of the case,
      i.e. 0-2, 3-18 or >=19. Note: for a small number of cases this
      information is not available (\code{NA}).}
    \item{BLOCK, start:}{Block ID and start time (in days since origin) of
      the cell in the spatio-temporal endemic covariate grid, which the
      event belongs to.} 
    \item{popdensity:}{Population density at the location of the event
      (corresponds to population density of the district where the event is
      located).}
  }
  There are further auxiliary columns attached to the events' data
  the names of which begin with a . (dot): These are created during
  conversion to the \code{"epidataCS"} class and are necessary for
  fitting the data with \code{twinstim}, see the description of the
  \code{"\link{epidataCS}"}-class.
  With \code{coordinates(imdepi$events)} one obtains the (x,y) locations
  of the events.

  The identifier in \code{tile} is indexed according to
  the German official municipality key (
  \dQuote{Amtlicher Gemeindeschl\enc{ü}{ue}ssel}). See
  \url{http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amtlicher_Gemeindeschl\%C3\%BCssel}
  for details.
  
  The data component \code{stgrid} contains the spatio-temporal grid of 
  endemic covariate information. In addition to the usual bookkeeping 
  variables this includes:
  \describe{
    \item{area:}{Area of the district \code{tile} in square kilometers.}
    \item{popdensity:}{Population density (inhabitants per square
      kilometer) computed from DESTATIS (Federal Statistical Office)
      information (Date: 31.12.2008) on communities level (LAU2)
      aggregated to district level (NUTS3).} 
  }
  
  The entry \code{W} contains the observation window as a
  \code{\link{SpatialPolygons}} object. In this case the boundaries of
  Germany (simplified polygon to enhance speed).

  %% package \pkg{spatstat} with parameter \code{dmin = 10}.
  
  The entry \code{qmatrix} is a \eqn{2\times 2}{2 x 2} identity matrix
  indicating that no transmission between the two finetypes can occur.
