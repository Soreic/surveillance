\title{
  Fit a two-component spatio-temporal conditional intensity function model
}
\description{
  A twinstim model as described in Meyer (2010) is fitted to
  marked spatio-temporal point process data. This constitutes a
  regression approach for conditional intensity function modelling.
}
\usage{
twinstim(endemic, epidemic, siaf, tiaf, qmatrix = data$qmatrix, data, subset, na.action = na.fail, optim.args, nCub, partial = FALSE, finetune = TRUE, t0 = data$stgrid$start[1], T = tail(data$stgrid$stop, 1), typeSpecificEndemicIntercept = FALSE, model = FALSE)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{endemic}{
    Formula for the exponential (Cox-like multiplicative) endemic component. may contain offsets. If \code{~0} there will be no endemic component in the model.
}
  \item{epidemic}{
    Formula representing the epidemic model for the event-specific covariates determining infectivity. offsets are not implemented. If \code{~0} there will be no epidemic component in the model.
}
  \item{siaf}{
    Spatial interaction functions. May be \code{NULL} (or missing), a list
    (continous function) or numeric (knots of a step function).
}
\item{tiaf}{
    Temporal interaction functions. May be \code{NULL} (or missing), a list
    (continous function) or numeric (knots of a step function).
}
  \item{qmatrix}{
    Square indicator matrix (0/1 or \code{TRUE}/\code{FALSE}) for
    possible transmission between the event types. Will be internally
    converted to logical. Defaults to the Q matrix specified in data.
}
  \item{data}{
    An \code{epidataCS} object.
}
\item{subset}{
  Logical expression indicating events to keep: missing values are
  taken as false. The expression is evaluated in the context of the
  \code{data$events@data} \code{data.frame}
}
\item{na.action}{
  How to deal with missing values in '\code{data$events}'. Do not use
  'na.pass'. Missing values in the spatio-temporal grid '\code{data$stgrid}'
  are not accepted.
}
\item{optim.args}{
  \code{NULL} or an argument list passed to 'optim' containing at least
  the element 'par', the start values of the parameters in the order par
  = c(endemic, epidemic, siaf, tiaf).

  Exceptionally, the 'method' argument may also be "nlminb", in which
  case the 'nlminb' optimizer is used. This is also the default. In this case,
  the only control parameters available are \code{maxit}, \code{REPORT},
  \code{abstol}, and \code{reltol}, which are passed appropriately to
  \code{nlminb}.

  If 'optim.args' is \code{NULL} then no optimization will be performed but
  the necessary functions will be returned in a list (similar to
  '\code{model = TRUE}').
}
\item{nCub}{
  Determines the accuracy of the cubature of the 'siaf' function. If \code{siaf$Fcircle} is specified, nCub = effRange/eps, where eps is used as pixel width and height in the two-dimensional midpoint rule (see polyCub.midpoint). Thus nCub is the desired number of subdivions of effRange in both dimensions and eps = effRange/nCub. If \code{siaf$Fcircle} is missing, nCub equals the above mentioned eps.
}
\item{partial}{
  Logical indicating if the partial log-likelihood proposed by Diggle et
  al. (2009) should be used.
}
\item{finetune}{
  Logical indicating if a second maximisation should be performed with
  robust Nelder-Mead optim using as starting point the resulting
  parameters from the first maximisation. Default value is TRUE.
}
\item{t0}{
  Events having occured during (-Inf;t0] are regarded as part of the
  prehistory H_0 of the process. The time point 't0' must be an element
  of data$stgrid$start. By default it is the earliest time point of the
  spatio-temporal grid of 'data'.
}
\item{T}{
  Only use events that occured up to time T. The time point 'T' must be
  an element of data$stgrid$stop. By default it is the latest time point
  of the spatio-temporal grid of 'data'.
}
\item{typeSpecificEndemicIntercept}{
  Use type-specific endemic intercepts instead of the global endemic intercept?
}
  \item{model}{
    Logical. If \code{TRUE} the result contains an element \code{functions} with
    the log-likelihood function, and optionally the score function and
    the fisher information function. The environment of those functions
    equals the evaluation environment of the fitting function, i.e. it
    is kept in the workspace and the necessary model frames are still
    available when \code{twinstim} has finished.
}
}
\details{
  The function performs maximum likelihood inference
  for the additive-multiplicative spatio-temporal intensity model
  described in Meyer et al. (2010). It uses 'nlminb' as the default optimizer
  (Newton-algorithm) and returns an object of class \code{twinstim}.
  Such ojects have working \code{print},
  \code{plot} and \code{summary} functions. The output of can again be
  processed by the \code{toLatex} function. Furthermore, the usual model
  fit functions such as \code{coef}, \code{vcov} and \code{logLik} work.
  A specific add on is the use of the function \code{R0}.
}
\value{
  Returns an S3 object of class "twinstim".
