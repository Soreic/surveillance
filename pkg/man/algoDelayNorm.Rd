\title{The function takes \code{range} values of the surveillance time
series \code{sts} and for each time point uses a Bayesian model of the negative binomial family with

}
\arguments{
\item{sts}{sts-object to be analysed. Needs to have a reporting triangle.}

\item{control}{list with control arguments}

\item{b}{How many years back in time to include when forming the base counts.}

\item{w}{Window's half-size, i.e. number of weeks to include before and after the current week in each year.}

\item{range}{Specifies the index of all timepoints which should be tested. If range is \code{NULL} all possible timepoints are used.}

\item{pastAberrations}{Boolean indicating whether to include an effect for past outbreaks
in a second fit of the model}

\item{verbose}{Boolean specifying whether to show extra debugging information.}

\item{alpha}{An approximate (one-sided) \eqn{(1-\alpha)\cdot 100\%}
prediction interval is calculated unlike the original method where it was a two-sided interval. The upper limit of this interval
i.e. the \eqn{(1-\alpha)\cdot 100\%} quantile serves as an upperbound.}

\item{trend}{Boolean indicating whether a trend should be included}

\item{noPeriods}{Number of levels in the factor allowing to use more baseline. If
equal to 1 no factor variable is created, the set of reference values is defined as in
Farrington et al (1996).}

\item{pastWeeksNotIncluded}{Number of past weeks to ignore in the calculation.}

\item{delay}{Boolean indicating whether to take reporting delays into account.}

\item{mc.munu}{Number of samples for the parameters of the negative binomial distribution
when performing Monte Carlo to calculate a threshold}

\item{mc.y}{Number of samples for observations
when performing Monte Carlo to calculate a threshold}

\item{limit54}{c(cases,period) is a vector allowing the
user to change these numbers.}
